Next steps:
* Is there a way to take all this model-stats stuff (with figures, etc.) and put it into a function
  so that I can just input different models with different features and interactions and stuff and
  have it automatically generate the stats and plots and stuff for me? DONE
* Add more features
    -> traffic
    -> gloomy for the past three days DONE
    -> Yankees/Mets win/lose
    -> ***day of the week*** DONE
* Add DOW feature and see how it affects model! DONE
* Modify R function to test model on TEST data DONE
* Download baseball data and add it in. (Is it worth it to go through all that scraping to construct a feature that I'm pretty sure won't be useful?)
* Add comments to all scripts to make them more clear and explain purpose

We don't care about the actual number of noise complaints - we care about the percent of complaints on any given day that are noise complaints. => # noise / # complaints => probability, on any given day, that a complaint is a noise complaint. So maybe, this would be better suited as a logistic regression problem?
