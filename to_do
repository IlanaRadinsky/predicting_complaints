Next steps:
* Is there a way to take all this model-stats stuff (with figures, etc.) and put it into a function
  so that I can just input different models with different features and interactions and stuff and
  have it automatically generate the stats and plots and stuff for me?
* Add more features
    -> traffic
    -> gloomy for the past three days
    -> Yankees/Mets win/lose
    -> ***day of the week***

We don't care about the actual number of noise complaints - we care about the percent of complaints on any given day that are noise complaints. => # noise / # complaints => probability, on any given day, that a complaint is a noise complaint. So maybe, this would be better suited as a logistic regression problem?
