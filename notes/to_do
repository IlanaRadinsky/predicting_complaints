Next steps:
* Write up summary page of conclusions
    -> use precision, accuracy, fpr, tpr, auc
    -> reference calibration plot
    -> use coefficients to say what is correlated vs. what is not correlated
    -> explain how noise complaints are a proxy for subjective complaints
    
Future work:
* Add more features
    -> traffic
    -> Yankees/Mets win/lose (requires scraping)
    -> other environmental features?
* See if there are similar trends for other "subjective" compaints (graffiti, etc.)

Completed:
* Is there a way to take all this model-stats stuff (with figures, etc.) and put it into a function
  so that I can just input different models with different features and interactions and stuff and
  have it automatically generate the stats and plots and stuff for me? DONE
* Add more features
    -> gloomy for the past three days DONE
    -> ***day of the week*** DONE
* Add DOW feature and see how it affects model! DONE
* Modify R function to test model on TEST data DONE
* Add comments to all scripts to make them more clear and explain purpose DONE

We don't care about the actual number of noise complaints - we care about the percent of complaints on any given day that are noise complaints. => # noise / # complaints => probability, on any given day, that a complaint is a noise complaint. So maybe, this would be better suited as a logistic regression problem?
