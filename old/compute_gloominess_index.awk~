# Weather:
# FG = fog
# TS = thunder
# PL = ice pellets, sleet, snow pellets or small hail
# GR = hail
# GL = glaze or rime
# DU = dust, volcanic ash, blowing dust, blowing sand, or blowing obstruction
# HZ = smoke or haze
# BLSN = blowing or drifting snow
# FC = tornado, water spout, or funnel cloud
# WIND = high or damaging winds
# BLPY = blowing spray
# BR = mist
# DZ = drizzle
# FZDZ = freezing drizzle
# RA = rain
# FZRA = freezing rain
# SN = snow, snow pellets, snow grains, or ice crystals
# UP = unknown precipitation
# MIFG = ground fog
# FZFG = ice fog or freezing fog
#
# Conclusion: Any weather is bad weather
#
# Sky Conditions:
# CLR = clear sky
# FEW = few clouds
# SCT = scattered clouds
# BKN = broken clouds
# OVC = overcast
# VV = obscured sky
# 10 = partially obscured sky
